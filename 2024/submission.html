            <p>
              Software visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain.
            </p>

            <p>
              The VISSOFT conference is principally a venue for publishing and discussing research related to software visualization. Consequently, VISSOFT brings together a community of researchers from software engineering, information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization.
              VISSOFT, co-located with ICSME, encourages a variety of submissions that address outstanding challenges in software systems using visualization. This includes technical papers, evaluations, and papers that present novel ideas and tools.

            <p>We solicit papers that present original, unpublished research results. Papers will be rigorously reviewed by an international program committee. In addition to full technical papers, VISSOFT features both a New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) Track and a Tools Track whose purpose is to present an idea still under development or to demonstrate the functionality of a newly developed tool. All accepted submissions will appear in the conference proceedings and the IEEE Digital Library.</p>

            <p>The paper obtaining the <strong>VISSOFT Best Paper Award</strong> will be invited to submit an extended version to <strong>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.</strong></p>

However, the 10-page limit does not include the bibliography, which is limited to two additional pages.</p>

                <p>All papers are required to include a user evaluation demonstrating their effectiveness, such as showcasing improvements over comparable tools or, if novel, demonstrating their utility and practical application. These papers will undergo evaluation using the same criteria as those in the Research track. </p>

                <p>The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is highly encouraged to show interaction possibilities where this matters for understanding of the paper.

                <p>The Tools Track of VISSOFT accepts submissions describing already implemented and functional tools. Contributions to the Tools Track have a limit of 4 pages for short papers, and a limit of 10 pages for long papers (in both cases including all figures, tables, and appendices). For bibliography, short papers can use up to one additional page, and long papers up to two additional pages.
                </p>

                <p>Tools Track papers describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights. We also invite submitting significant evolutions of tools already presented (in past VISSOFT editions or in other venues).</p>

                <p>Short tool papers usually just describe the presented tool, and will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest. Long tool papers are expected to present a user evaluation which shows evidence of its effectiveness, for instance, improvements over other similar tools, or if it is novel, showing its utility and practical use. Long papers will be evaluated following the same criteria as in the Research track.</p>

                <p>The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is mandatory. Authors should add a URL to the video at the end of the abstract (e.g., Video URL: https://youtu.be/XXX).</p>

            <h2>Showcase Session</h2>

            <p>As successfully done in the past, at VISSOFT 2024 authors of all accepted papers in all tracks, and specially in the Tools Track, will be invited to demonstrate their approaches and tools to the participants in an informal setting. More details will follow a few weeks before the conference.</p>

            <a name="howto"></a>
            <h2>How to submit</h2>
            <p>Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Please use the
              available IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings: <a
                href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>
            </p>

            <p>If a submission is accepted for the journal-first program, at least one author of the associated journal
              paper must register and present the paper at the conference.</p>

            <p>Supplemental material (e.g., video, data, software) that might be helpful for reviewers can be linked in
              your paper.</p>

            <p><b>Note: VISSOFT uses a single-blind review process</b> (i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors
              are revealed to reviewers but reviewers' identities are not revealed to authors).</p>
