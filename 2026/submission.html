            <h1>Call for Papers</h1>
           
            <p>
              Software visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain.
            </p>

            <p>
              The VISSOFT conference is principally a venue for publishing and discussing research related to software visualization. Consequently, VISSOFT brings together a community of researchers from software engineering, information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization.
            </p>

            <p>
              VISSOFT, co-located with ICSME, encourages a variety of submissions that address outstanding challenges in software systems using visualization.
            </p>

            <p>We solicit papers that present original, unpublished research results. Papers will be rigorously reviewed by an international program committee. In addition to full technical papers, VISSOFT features both a New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) Track and a Tools Track whose purpose is to present an idea still under development or to demonstrate the functionality of a newly developed tool. This year we present a new Visualization Challenge, with the goal to  apply research efforts towards a collective software engineering dataset. All accepted submissions will appear in the conference proceedings and the IEEE Digital Library.</p>

              <div class="panel-body">
                

                <p>A paper submitted to the Research Track must describe an in-depth and mature research result relevant to software visualization. The content of a technical paper can be a maximum of 10 pages long (including all figures, tables, and appendices). However, the 10-page limit does not include the bibliography, which is limited to two additional pages.</p>

                <p>All paper types common in information visualization (technique, design study/application, system, evaluation, and model, as described in [1]) could be accepted for presentation. When convenient, papers should include a user evaluation demonstrating their effectiveness, such as showcasing improvements over comparable tools or, if novel, demonstrating their utility and practical application. However, depending on the kind of paper, maybe results can be shown to be sound without a user evaluation. This could be the case, for example, of structured literature reviews, or of papers solving specific problems already shown to be relevant for users, or to address relevant technical problems.</p>
                
                <p>The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is highly encouraged to show interaction possibilities where this matters for understanding of the paper. Even when for convenience the video could be uploaded to some streaming platform, it is encouraged that it is also archived in an open access archive, such as Zenodo. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package, also archived in an open access archive. Authors who provide a video and/or a reproduction package should add the corresponding links in a specific section at the end of the paper (“Supplementary materials” section).</p>

                <p><b>Paper Awards: </b> VISSOFT 2025 may award distinguished technical papers. In case a paper is awarded as “best paper”, it will be invited to submit an extended version, with at least 30% of new materials, to the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics journal. This submission will go through the usual peer review process of the journal, and is not guaranteed to be accepted.</p>

                <p><b>Artifact Evaluation:</b> Paper authors are encouraged to submit research artifacts (e.g., tools, data repositories, frameworks, videos) for evaluation. For more details, please refer to the 
                  <a href="submission.html#artifact">Artifact Evaluation Track.</a></p>

                <p>The Tools Track of VISSOFT accepts submissions describing already implemented and functional tools. Contributions to the Tools Track have a limit of 4 pages for short papers, and a limit of 10 pages for long papers (in both cases including all figures, tables, and appendices). For bibliography, short papers can use up to one additional page, and long papers up to two additional pages.</p>

                <p>Tools Track papers describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights. We also invite submitting significant evolutions of tools already presented (in past VISSOFT editions or in other venues).</p>
                
                <p>Evaluation criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short tool papers usually just describe the presented tool, and will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest.</li>
                    <li>Long tool papers are expected to present a user evaluation which shows evidence of its effectiveness, for instance, improvements over other similar tools, or if it is novel, showing its utility and practical use. Long papers will be evaluated following the same criteria as in the Research track.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is mandatory. Even when for convenience the video could be uploaded to some streaming platform, it is encouraged that it is also archived in an open access archive, such as Zenodo. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts, such as the tool presented in the paper, in a reproduction package, also archived in an open access archive.

                <p>A submission to the VISSOFT 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the
                  following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The paper was accepted by a relevant journal and it is in the scope of the conference</li>
                  <li>The paper was published between July 1, 2023 and July 11, 2025</li>
                  <li>The paper reports new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend, and were not previously reported in, prior work</li>
                  <li>The paper has not been presented at and is not under consideration for journal-first programs of other conferences</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Authors of a paper that meets these criteria are invited to submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, a short statement on how the work satisfies the journal first criteria, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Website. If the paper is not online yet, then specify so. The original paper (or a preprint) should also be sent during submission.</p>

                <p>The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the Conference proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program. Journal first presentations will have a presentation time similar to technical papers.</p>

                <p>The poster track of VISSOFT provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss their work and get feedback from knowledgeable sources at an early stage of their research.</p>

                <p>The poster track of VISSOFT accepts two-page documents, typically combining text and images, that embody a succinct description of work that has been done. Presenting a poster is a good way to discuss and receive feedback on a work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not present previously published work.</p>
                
                <p>Poster manuscripts will be part of the Conference proceedings, and evaluated by the Program Co-Chairs on their suitability to VISSOFT topics of interest.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Git repositories: 
                    <a href="https://git.kernel.org/">Kernel.org git repositories</a></li>
                  <li>PatchWork Projects: 
                    <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/">Project List - Patchwork</a></li>
                  <li>GitHub mirror for Torvalds repository: 
                    <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">torvalds/linux: Linux kernel source tree</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Examples of Datasets that can be used (if you happen to know any other dataset, inform the PC chairs so we can include it in this list):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Yulin Xu and Minghui Zhou. 2018. A multi-level dataset of Linux kernel patchwork. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR '18). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 54–57. 
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196475">https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196475</a></li>
                  <li>Maes Bermejo, M., Gonzalez-Barahona, J. M., Gallego, M., & Robles, G. (2023). A dataset of Linux Kernel commits [Data set]. Zenodo. 
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10654193">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10654193</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Examples of submissions could be a research team applying one of their tools to the dataset, or a part of it, aiming for a specific outcome; some analytical and empirical approaches with visual outputs; the customization of a tool to analyze a specific aspect of the Linux kernel which could include the source code, developer contributors or the bug fixes to the project; etc. In general, visualizations that help to understand the utility of tools (using the Linux kernel as a use case), or which show interesting aspects of the Linux kernel, will be welcome.</p>

                <p>The visualization challenge track of VISSOFT 2025 accepts submissions composed of a short abstract, a video (up to 5 minutes in length), and optionally (but conveniently) a link to a tool demo. Authors should add the URL to the video at the end of the abstract (e.g., Video URL: https://youtu.be/XXX).</p>

                <p>Challenge abstracts will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest.</p>

                <p>After notification, accepted papers must submit a 2-4 page submission of the challenge, that must describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights of the kernel.</p>

                <p>Challenge manuscripts will be part of the Conference proceedings, and evaluated by the Program Co-Chairs, based on their suitability for VISSOFT topics of interest.</p>

            <h2>Showcase Session</h2>
            
            
            <p>As successfully done in the past, at VISSOFT 2025 authors of all accepted papers in all tracks, and specially in the Tools Track and in the Visualization Challenge Track, will be invited to demonstrate their approaches and tools to the participants in an informal setting. More details will follow a few weeks before the conference.</p>
            

            <a name="howto"></a>
            <h2>How to submit</h2>
            
            <p>Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format and the page. Please use the available IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings: 
              <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html</a>
            </p>

            <p>If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the associated journal paper must register and present the paper at the conference.</p>

            <p>Supplemental material (e.g., video, data, software) that might be helpful for reviewers can be linked in your paper. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive. Authors who provide a video and/or a reproduction package should add the corresponding links in a specific section at the end of the paper (“Supplementary materials” section).</p>
